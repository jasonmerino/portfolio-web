## K552-N KUMARA mechanical keyboard by Redragon

I purchased this keyboard months ago and it has proven to be a fantastic investment. The keys have a good spring back and a satisfying click as you type away. It actually makes my day better just listening to myself type. Also, it's a very affordable mechanical keyboard. I picked this one up for around \$25. If you are looking to get more enjoyment out of your daily typing, the [K552-N KUMARA mechanical keyboard by Redragon](https://amzn.to/2RHqVA7) is the way to go.
