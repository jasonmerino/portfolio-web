I'm currently working as a senior full-stack software engineer (although my title is technically senior mobile software engineer) at [Sage Intacct](https://www.sageintacct.com/). I work on the [Sage Intelligent Time](https://www.sageintacct.com/products/accounting-software/advanced-functionality/intelligent-time) product building the mobile client, web client, and APIs.

Previously, I was a senior innovation developer in the [Ferguson Ventures](https://fergusonventures.com/) Innovation Lab. I worked on prototypes in AR, Voice, and native with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

I love to learn new things and play around with new technology.

I've authored [react-native-simple-store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-simple-store) and I'm a [jQuery contributor](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt#L214).

I've been working on the web for a while now. I started my first [e-commerce site selling car covers](http://carcovers.org/) in 1998 with my siblings. It's still up and running although we've have sold it and moved on to other projects.

If you're interested, check out some of the [other projects I work on](https://jasonmerino.me/projects).
