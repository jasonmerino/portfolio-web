I've been running across this idea quite a bit lately. I think I first noticed it when reading through one of the [FI Weekly](https://www.choosefi.com/read/newsletter/) emails. At the bottom of every one of these weekly emails [Brad Barrett](https://www.choosefi.com/about/) lists different actions that the Choose FI community has sent in. These actions are different ways that the community members are making their lives better either in regards to financial independence or just in general. Many of them start out with "my 1% for this week...".

After reading through the list of things that this awesome community is up to I was getting really curious what this 1% better was. So of course I plugged "1% better" into the Google machine and found out that the idea of 1% better is championed by author [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/). He writes about continuous self improvement based on this idea:

> If you get one percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.

(This is a direct quote from James Clear's page on [Continuous Improvement](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement). I encourage anyone who has the time or interest to look into his methods and thinking to do so. It _will_ be worth your time.)

This is a powerful idea for crafting a life which is worth living. While the 37% better you in one year math may not work out exactly if you implement this way of thinking (I'm not even sure how one would measure this to check the math), taking small incremental changes to make your life better is the only way to consistently improve anything in your life.


## Practices for becoming 1% better

Now that I've explained a bit of the idea behind 1% better I wanted to record a list of 1% better actions that I could add to my daily routine to make it easier to stay the course every day. Below you will find a list of ideas that I have taken from other sites* which talk about self improvement as well as some of my own that I've implemented. I've attempted to organize each idea into separate categories so that I can make sure that I'm focusing on various areas of improvement.

## Always forward, never back

In the sprit of always moving forward toward that 1% better I've found that further education and action is always helpful. If you're interested you should check out James Clear's book on forming habits that stick. It's called [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0593189647?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLQ4TiFKGLYK9A_AKOLcUBiMaDFBgGsdieOwwG0W9xHrEJoqXVNqElhoC-msQAvD_BwE&hvadid=326596815255&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032602&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=13113154725595297116&hvtargid=kwd-546029284202&hydadcr=15490_10339756&keywords=atom+habits&qid=1617223225&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=letsgarden08-20&linkId=921098cbb9725da1a65f6ed281fc030e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and it's definitely worth the read.
