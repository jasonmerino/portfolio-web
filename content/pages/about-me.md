I am a senior innovation developer in the [Ferguson Ventures](https://fergusonventures.com/) Innovation Lab. I am currently working on prototypes in AR, Voice, and native with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). I love to learn new things and play around with new technology.

I've authored [react-native-simple-store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-simple-store) and I'm a [jQuery contributor](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt#L214).

I've been working on the web for a while now. I started my first [e-commerce site selling car covers](http://carcovers.org/) in 1998 with my siblings. It's still up and running although we've have sold it and moved on to other projects.

If you're interested, check out some of the [other projects I work on](https://jasonmerino.me/projects).
