Today I needed to see some hidden files inside finder to make sure that when copying from one folder to another one, all the files that I needed came along for the ride. The shortcut in the previous OS was just `CMD + .`, but that wasn't working for me in macOS Catalina.

After a little searching I found the new shortcut! Here it is.

```
CMD + Shift + Fn + .
```

That should get hidden files toggling on and off for you in Finder. Cheers! üçª
